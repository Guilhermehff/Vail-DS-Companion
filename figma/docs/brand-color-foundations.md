# Brand Color Foundations

This workflow governs how brand-provided colors become durable design-system artifacts before any Figma write.

## Core Rules

1. Start from the official source artifact and prefer provided RGB or HEX values over sampling.
2. Preserve all source swatches, labels, usage scopes, and channel restrictions in the intake and preview artifacts.
3. Reuse existing universal tokens first, especially `universal/white` and `universal/black`.
4. Add brand families only for materially distinct brand hues or contractually important neutrals.
5. Keep raw brand families in `_Global: Color` and keep them on the shared `100-900` scale.
6. If a brand family is acting as a neutral system color, especially for backgrounds or system surfaces, map it to the semantic neutral role set instead of a brand accent lane.
7. Generate ramps in `OKLCH` and validate contrast before proposing a write.
8. Produce a preview artifact before any write is proposed or executed.
9. Register the approved artifact paths in `figma/brands/<brand>/brand.yml`.

## Brand-Centered Output

Every reviewed brand should have:

- a canonical brand record in `figma/brands/registry.yml`
- a per-brand manifest at `figma/brands/<brand>/brand.yml`
- color staging space at `figma/brands/<brand>/color/`
- approved intake and preview artifacts referenced from the brand manifest
- Figma provenance captured in the manifest and intake artifact; preview Markdown should stay focused on review content unless a node-specific reference materially helps

When a local export is explicitly requested, store the dated snapshot under `figma/exports/` and treat it as potentially stale relative to live Figma.

## Intake Workflow

1. Confirm the brand record or create it if it does not exist.
2. Record the source reference and source swatches in the intake artifact.
3. Mark each source swatch as `reuse_universal`, `new_brand_family`, or `hold_for_review`.
4. Choose stable hue-based family names.
5. Assign the source anchor step and expand the family to the full scale.
6. Document role-set recommendations for `neutral`, `brand`, `brand_secondary`, any global-only extra family, and any role-specific exceptions.
7. If a brand color is being used as a background or system neutral, recommend it for the semantic neutral role set before considering any accent lane.
8. Capture downstream review guidance for web, email, and ads.
9. Generate the preview artifact and link both artifacts from the brand manifest.

## Inventory Impact

- Global color writes belong in `_Global: Color`.
- Shared semantic theme color ladders belong in `Semantic: Theme`.
- Brand semantic overrides live in Figma. Create dated exports under `figma/exports/` only when an audit or manual snapshot is explicitly requested.
- Treat exports under `figma/exports/` as dated reference snapshots, not as live governance state.

## Templates

Use [brand-color-intake.yml](/Users/guilhermefidelio/Documents/GitHub/Vail Resorts DS/figma/templates/brand-color-intake.yml) for intake work.
Use [brand-color-preview.md](/Users/guilhermefidelio/Documents/GitHub/Vail Resorts DS/figma/templates/brand-color-preview.md) for the required pre-write preview.
