## Original Source Roles

- Source role: `headline`
  Family: `Graphik`
  Safe family: `Montserrat`
  Style: `Bold`
  Weight label: `Bold`
  Usage scope: `primary_headers_h1`
  Case: `sentence_case`
  Tracking: `75`
  Leading: `not specified in source`
  Size rule: `source names the role and tracking but does not define governed numeric sizes`
  Punctuation: `not specified in source`
  Sample copy: `We lift people up.`
  Notes: The typography sheet explicitly labels Graphik Bold for Primary Headers (H1). The source does not specify the tracking unit, so the artifact preserves the numeric label as shown.

- Source role: `secondary_header`
  Family: `Graphik`
  Safe family: `Montserrat`
  Style: `Regular`
  Weight label: `Regular`
  Usage scope: `secondary_headers_h2`
  Case: `sentence_case`
  Tracking: `75`
  Leading: `not specified in source`
  Size rule: `source names the role and tracking but does not define governed numeric sizes`
  Punctuation: `not specified in source`
  Sample copy: `We elevate spirits by creating fun, invigorating mountain experiences for everyone.`
  Notes: The typography sheet explicitly labels Graphik Regular for Secondary Headers (H2).

- Source role: `body`

  Safe family: `Open Sans`
  Style: `Light`
  Weight label: `Light`
  Usage scope: `body_copy`
  Case: `sentence_case`
  Tracking: `25`
  Leading: `not specified in source`
  Size rule: `source names the role and tracking but does not define governed numeric sizes`
  Punctuation: `sentence punctuation allowed`
  Sample copy: `Memories and stories of which are the reason families continue to leave their homes, flock to the mountains, and enjoy the awe-inspiring outdoors to be uplifted again and again.`

- Source role: `subheader`
  Family: `Neutraface Text`
