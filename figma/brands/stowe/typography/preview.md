## Original Source Roles

  Style: `Regular`
  Weight label: `Regular`
  Usage scope: `primary_display_headline`
  Case: `uppercase`
  Tracking: `0px`
  Leading: `font_size_times_1`
  Size rule: `source defines case, weight language, and relational leading but no governed numeric size`
  Punctuation: `not specified in source`
  Sample copy: `STEP INTO THE ALLURE`
  Notes: The source explicitly labels the headline family as Athena Regular, and the user approved the live write to treat the supporting prose word `bold` as a copy mistake.

  Safe family: `Italiana`
  Style: `Bold`
  Weight label: `Bold`
  Usage scope: `supporting_headline_copy`
  Case: `title_case`
  Tracking: `0px`
  Leading: `font_size_times_1_5`
  Size rule: `source defines relational leading but no governed numeric size`
  Punctuation: `not specified in source`
